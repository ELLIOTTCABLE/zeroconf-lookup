Railduino Zeroconf-Lookup is a browser extension for finding local web servers using the mDNS-SD protocol. The acronym mDNS-SD stands for "Multicast Domain Name System - Service Discovery" and provides a mechanism whereby web servers announce their IP address and port. The technology is commonly called Zeroconf, Apple calls it Bonjour. For security reasons browsers do not use Zeroconf anymore. The extension requires a companion program called a "Native Messaging Host" which needs to be installed separately. It can be found under https://github.com/railduino/zeroconf-lookup and is open source under the MIT license.
