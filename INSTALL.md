# Installing zeroconf\_lookup

**zeroconf\_lookup** is a browser extension for **Firefox** and **Chrome** / **Chromium**.
It consists of two parts:
1. The *browser extension* itself is available through the appropriate app store
2. The so called *native host* needs to be installed by the user with operating system specific procedures

This file provides instructions for installing the *native host* in various environments.

## Installing on OS X / macOS

The common setup is to install one executable (`zeroconf_lookup`) either at `/usr/local/bin` or at any location local to the running user.
In any case the *browser manifest* must be installed with a reference to this location. This is done by `zeroconf_lookup -i`
