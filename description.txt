Railduino Zeroconf-Lookup is a browser extension for finding
local web servers using the mDNS-SD protocol. The acronym
mDNS-SD stands for "Multicast Domain Name System - Service
Discovery" and provides a mechanism whereby web servers
announce their IP address and port. The technology is called
Zeroconf or Bonjour in the Apple universe. For security
reasons browsers do not use Zeroconf anymore. The extension
requires a companion program called a "Native Messaging Host"
which needs to be installed separately. It can be found under
the https://github.com/railduino/zeroconf-lookup URL.
